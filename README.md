# Konas-Deobf-Remap
Konas Client

Binseured with strong binsecure config

Class renamer enabled
```
1st, Deobfuscated

2nd, remped to mincraft mappings

3rd, field and method names renamed to generic and valid names, removing obfuscation via aggresive overloding

4th, Various tweaks, and manual remaping started

5th, Decompiled, using aproximatly 95% CFR, 4.5% Procyon, 0.5% Fernflower

6th, Loaded into gradle project, and Continued manual remap using refactoring tools in Intelij
```
# What is manual remaping?

Some obfuscators will rename classes, fields(variables), and methods to different names, in order to impede readablility of the code. Sometimes, obfuscators will even rename names to names that are illegal in java, but perfectly legal in bytecode (such as names starting in numbers). Sometimes obfuscators will use a feature called method overloading to overload unrelated methods in order to obfuscate. This can be overcome by renaming all classes, methods, and fields to generic, legal names. Once this is done, readability can be improved by "Manually remaping" these classes, methods, and fields to common sense names that make it look more like a client. Example: ClassXXX, contains string "AutoCrystal" in its super constructor, so the class is renamed to AutoCrystal, and moved to directory "me/darki/konas/module/combat"

# For Skids

Skid it.

It is NOT buildable (and never will be unless someone else does it)

As stated earlier, this deobf is remapped. Dont get the remaped "Field*****" names confused with the minecraft mapping names, or else you will look really dumb.

Skiding is cringe
